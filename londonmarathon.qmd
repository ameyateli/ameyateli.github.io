This data comes from  Nicola Rennie's 
[LondonMarathon R Package](https://github.com/nrennie/LondonMarathon) contining two data sets scraped from Wikipedia on (1 November 2022) on London Marathon winners, and some general data.  

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-04-25')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 17)

winners <- tuesdata$winners
london_marathon <- tuesdata$london_marathon

ggplot(data = london_marathon, aes(x=Year, y=Accepted)) +
  geom_point() + labs(title ="Number of Accepted Runners vs Year")

 
```
